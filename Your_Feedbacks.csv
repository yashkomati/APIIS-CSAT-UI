He has been instrumental in clarifying doubts we had with documentation. \\Not sure if the correct place to comment this, but docs are not very clear on what tokens (rdt, access_token, Auth credentials etc) you should use with each request, this is just fine for anyone using one of the many libraries available to communicate with the API, but it presents challenges for anyone developing in a language that does not have an sp-api library. \Would also be awesome if it was possible to create ""dummy orders"" to test with. I understand that in a live system that may represent distortions on automated statistics, but if those orders could be somehow signalled as ""test orders"",  ex if they contained only ""unlisted products"", then it would be possible to filter them out.  This would make it a lot easier to test the integrations and clarify any doubts that may arise from documentation.",38.7552,-9.2465,-1,HARISH GANESAN,A3PNJAV4CVI5V1HARISH GANESAN
